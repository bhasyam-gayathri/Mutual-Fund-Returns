### Project Overview

 Problem statement
The data given is of the mutual funds in USA. The objective of this problem is to predict the ‘basis point spread’ over AAA bonds i.e. feature ‘bonds_aaa’ against each Serial Number.
Basis Point Spread indicates the additional return a mutual fund would give over the AAA rated bonds.



### Learnings from the project

 How to apply linear model using GridsearchCV
How to use Chi square contengency test to determine if two columns are dependant 
How to use box plot to check for outliers


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Checked two columns dependancy using chi square technique and removed columns which are correlated.
Checked for outliers using boxplots
Used linear regression model and made the performace better using GridsearchCV in lasso and ridge regressor
